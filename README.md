Guidelines for Final Project (Marketing Plan) 
Learning objective: Learning is not a spectator sport and requires a   lot   of   practice.   This   group project   gives you the   opportunity to   apply   the   material   covered   throughout   the   quarter   and   deepen   your   understanding.   The   goal   is   to create a compelling and consistent marketing plan that proposes and credibly supports specific IBP strategies aimed at increasing fruit or vegetable consumption (overall category demand or selective demand stimulation).
Topic: 
Your marketing plan will be written for the produce industry, promoting one of   the following:
•                A fruit or vegetable category (e.g., Hass Avocados).
•                A branded fruit or vegetable (e.g., Driscoll’s Berries).
•                A fruit or vegetable product (e.g., Pom Pomegranate Juice).
•                A   more   general   public   awareness   campaign   (e.g.,FNV campaign).
Note: The examples given here are examples covered in class. I have and   continue to work closely with   the Hass Avocado Board and the Marketing team at Driscoll’s. You are   free to   come up with ideas,   in   any   other   produce category (including floral) or brand, introduce a new   fruit   or vegetable to the   U.S. market,   or promote a processed and packaged product that lists fruits and/or vegetables as an ingredient. Your plan   can   be pitched to a marketing order or board representing an entire product category, an   existing brand,   or to investors (e.g., you are pitching a start-up). If   you are unsure whether your   ideas   fit within   the parameters described here, please do not hesitate to ask and discuss your ideas with me.
Structure: 
Your marketing plan needs to clearly communicate:
To whom are you presenting your marketing plan (e.g., Hass Avocado Board, Driscoll’s, The Wonderful company, investors, etc.) and why (would they invest in your proposed marketing)? 
Who is your target audience for your promoted product and why (would   these   consumers   buy   your product)?
What do   you   want to accomplish? What are your specific objectives and how do   you plan to   reach   those goals? What are your main messages and how do you communicate them?
How will you measure your success and prove that you reached your goals?
Please follow the general structure either by creating sections or addressing each in a continuous text:
1.             Executive   Summary and   Objectives   (Clearly   state your   objectives   and your why.)
2.                Situation analysis
3. Budgeting (This section is optional) 
4.                Strategy
5.               Execution
6.               Evaluation
Please also note that you will have to support your creative ideas with a thorough analysis and data whenever   available.
Groups: 
You will be working on this project in groups of   5-8 students. Groups will be formed during the first section meeting and final group assignments will be posted on Canvas by the end of the second week. Feel free to assign specific tasks to each other, but please be advised that each of you need to be familiar with and contribute to all aspects of this project. 
Deliverables: 
Your group has two options when completing this final project:
•                                           Introduce your ideas in a visually informative and creative presentation (during lectures).We   have   room   for   one   presentation   each   (no   more   than   15   minutes   and   10   slides)   on March 4, 6, and 11.   Groups   can   sign up   on   a   first   come-first   serve basis by   sending me   an   email   or   talking to   me   after   lecture   or   section.   If you代 写ARE 136 Guidelines for Final Project (Marketing Plan)R

Please also upload your slides as a pdf file as your final project submission on Canvas. Please note that not all group   members   have to   present, but everyone needs to   contribute   to   the   completion   of   the   presentation   (e.g., prepare   the   slides, etc.).•                                           Summarize your ideas in a persuasive written report (no more than five pages, not including a   cover page   and references).   This   document   should be   engaging   and informative   and you   can use   pictures   and graphs to support your   ideas.
Documents need to be   saved   as   a pdf file   and submitted via Canvas before the beginning of class on 
Marhc 13 (1.40 pm). 
•         Other than restrictions on length mentioned here, there are no additional format requirements. For both,
your presentation and written document. You are free to choose the   format   or   style. that best   supports your   ideas and communicates your message. However, you must cite your sources properly.    When referencing   in the text, please state author and year in parentheses. Also make sure you include   a   complete   list   of references at the end of   your presentation or written document. While I do not require   a   specific   style   of       citations, please make sure that you include all information and do not   just copy a   link. You   can   check the guidelines and sample referencesprovided   by   the   American   Economic   Association   (AEA) for   further guidance. If   you include graphics or photos that are not your own, please also make   sure   to reference   the   source   of   this   material, including   AI   generated   images. 
•         More   generally, we   do   not   prohibit   use   of   GenAI   (e.g., ChatGPT   and   Gemini), but   encourage you to be
thoughtful and transparent. When carefully checked for accuracy, these tools can   enhance your research and scientific writing, but overreliance on AI has been shown to hinder critical   reflection   and   erode expertise. These tools are trained to find patterns and generate text by predicting the likeliest response based on their training   data. They do not understand context or   create   original   ideas,   and they make   a   lot   of   mistakes. While they can help you brainstorm topics and provide basic editorial feedback, they are not   a substitute to reviewing the literature yourself, critically reflecting on and continuously editing your writing.   For   guidance   on   how   to   cite   your   AI   use, please   see   this link. If   you   are   looking   to   improve   your   writing,   I also   encourage   you   to   take   advantage   of   the   services   offered   by   the AATC Writing Support Center. 
Grading: 
You will be able to receive continuous feedback on your ideas and revise your plans throughout the quarter. However, only your final submission will be graded. All group members will receive the same grade for the marketing plan. Please be proactive and reach out if   one or more of   your group members are not participating.
If a member has not participated until week 8 of the quarter (Tuesday, February 25) he/she/they can be removed from the group upon request and will have to complete their own project. A   5-point penalty   will be applied to individually submitted projects unless an exception or   special permission was   granted. 
Please   note   that   the   final   project   assignment   created   on   Canvas   includes   a   rubric   for   additional   guidance regarding   grading   guidelines.
